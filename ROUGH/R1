i have Temporarily disabling v1 bean; re-enable with matchIfMissing=true before refactoring consumers

so classes using this:
<bean id="epwKmsAutoConfig" class="com.empower.epw.aws.kms.config.EpwKmsAutoConfig"/>

might face issues, right?

to one test class that was failing, i did this: @TestPropertySource(properties = "epw.aws.kms.sdk-version=v1")

but this bean id method what do i do?
and also, in some places i have used this <mockito:mock id="epwKmsService" class="com.empower.epw.aws.api.kms.EpwKmsService" />
what do i do for that?

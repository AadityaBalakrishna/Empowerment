Initially we moved the lighter modules with git history, but when we worked with frequently used module with daily commits, we faced an issue with code syncing the commit history daily while waiting for MR approvals or will solving the jenkins pipeline blockers



also while working with larger modules with 100+ files, being decomposed and distributed to different other repos, it was difficult to move with commit history and frequent code syncs,



due to these, we used the latest git commit revision link, and yes, i understand the git commit will point to my commit as the oldest commit in the new location of the file, but if navigated through the latest commit history link , we can find the git blame of the files before the migration



we also have a developers guide for the pcap-server decomposition in the confluence with the git commit history link for all the modules worked on"

As an AEXP Developer
I need to define and create IAM roles/policies for DynamoDB and Redis access as per database security requirements, so that the crm-rest-service can securely connect to AWS-managed databases in future phases.

Description:

Define IAM roles for crm-rest-service (IRSA-based).
Create minimal access policies for:
DynamoDB read/write (as applicable)
Redis (Elasticache) access (future-ready placeholder)
Align roles with AEXP security & DevOps naming conventions.
Store IAM definitions in Terraform/IaC module.
Integrate IAM role attachment into service account in Helm chart.
Document IAM policies and role attachment flow.

Acceptance Criteria:

IAM role created via IaC and attached to crm-rest-service service account using IRSA.
IAM policy contains only resource-specific ARNs — no wildcard permissions.
Terraform plan shows compliant, least-privilege policy JSON.
Role includes tags (Application=crm-rest-service, Environment=dev, etc.).
CI/CD validates Terraform and IAM policy using Checkov or similar scanner (no critical findings).
Role documented in /docs/security/iam-db-access.md with examples.
Deployment verified — EKS pod assumes IAM role correctly.
Logs confirm IRSA token mounted and assumed role credentials available.




Validation Steps:

IAM role provisioned in AWS and validated.
Service account in EKS annotated with IAM role ARN.
Documentation reviewed by security and DevOps.
Terraform module merged and reusable for future DB stories.




can you help me understand this task, and help me with example of codes i can find with the keywords for getting a reference on how to proceed with this task?

all i found in the code base was this:

{
        "Action" : [
          "dynamodb:GetItem",
          "dynamodb:GetRecords",
          "dynamodb:GetShardIterator",
          "dynamodb:Query",
          "dynamodb:Scan"
        ],
        "Resource" : "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:179355710817:table/vpc_devstaging_aggregation_event*",
        "Effect" : "Allow"
      },

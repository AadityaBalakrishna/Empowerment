1) Why CfgStoreLoader is made as a configuration class? ConfigClientProperties is defined & loaded by Autoconfiguration from epw-config-starters, right?

2) ConfigClientProperties is not a config class I remember.

3) user logger.methods() for logging & pass informative texts applicable to contex. However, if u wanted to do SOP() clean b4 pushing code.

4) version , add as a pom parameter defined on parent pom as a range.

5) why user is needed for this feature?

6) Assertions.assertEquals("batch_api_app_devstaging", user);
batch_api_app_devstaging == user?

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process based on the logs:  

### **Steps Taken in the Process**  

1. **Updating Job Control for `sp_schema.message_template_fact_map`**  
   - The job control entry for `sp_schema.message_template_fact_map` is updated.  
   - The status is set to **COMPLETED**.  
   - The `last_processed_date` is recorded as **2025-03-03 13:20:26**.  
   - The `write_lpd_flag` is marked as **True**.  
   - The execution phase is identified as **executeDeleteInsert**.  

2. **Inserting Job Execution History**  
   - The system prepares and executes an `INSERT` query to store job execution details in `pcap_control.job_execution_history`.  
   - The recorded values include:  
     - Job Name: `sp_schema.message_template_fact_map`  
     - Status: `JOB COMPLETED`  
     - Job Start Time: **2025-03-25 04:47:49**  
     - Job End Time: **2025-03-25 04:48:18**  
     - Last Processed Date: **2025-03-03 13:20:26**  

3. **S3 Cleanup Process**  
   - The system deletes a transformed key file from **S3 storage** (`s3://staging-redshift-data/...`).  
   - A log message confirms successful deletion:  
     - `"Successfully deleted transformed key file from S3."`  
   - Another log message confirms completion of S3 file deletion:  
     - `"s3 file deletion COMPLETED"`  

4. **Clearing Cache**  
   - The system clears the cache after job execution to ensure no stale data remains.  

5. **Final Confirmation and Exit**  
   - A log message confirms all steps were executed successfully:  
     - `"COMPLETED Successfully. If you see this message, then we acknowledge that the job has executed all the steps Successfully."`  
   - The process exits with **exit code 0**, meaning it completed successfully without errors.  

This breakdown provides a **clear view** of the job execution from updating job control to S3 cleanup and final confirmation.

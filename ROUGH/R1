now all the migration files are refactored, i want to test the consumers, 

before:
			String result = KMSServiceImpl.getInstance()
					.encryptUsingAWSKey(rawValue, this.getKeyManager()
							.getSystemPrimaryAliasName());	

now:

@Autowired
	private EpwKmsService epwKmsService;

			String result = epwKmsService.encryptUsingAWSKey(rawValue, this.getKeyManager()
					.getSystemPrimaryAliasName());


should it go to the new epwKmsService.encrypt or should it go to the old KMSserviceImpl which has been refactored

Does the test - WorkflowChainBuilderTest cover everything required for this task:

Task: Test WorkflowChainBuilder class chain building logic 

  

Classes Under Test: 

com.empower.crm.core.engine.chain.WorkflowChainBuilder 
com.empower.crm.core.engine.chain.WorkflowStepHandler 
com.empower.crm.core.engine.factory.WorkflowStepProcessorFactory 
  

Short Description: Unit test WorkflowChainBuilder class buildChain() method with mocked ApplicationContext. 

  

Detailed Description: Test WorkflowChainBuilder class buildChain() method by mocking Spring ApplicationContext to return test handler beans. Verify method constructs handler chains correctly with proper ordering and error handling. 

  

Scope: 

In Scope: 
Testing buildChain() method with mocked ApplicationContext 
Testing chain construction logic for all phases 
Testing bean retrieval from context with correct names 
Testing handler linking and ordering 
Testing exception handling for missing beans 
Testing empty phase configuration handling 
  

Out of Scope: 
Actual Spring bean resolution 
Handler execution logic 
Workflow execution 
Bean lifecycle management 
  

Test Points: 

Test buildChain() retrieves beans from context with correct bean names 
Test buildChain() creates chain with handlers in correct phase order 
Test buildChain() links handler.setNext() correctly 
Test buildChain() throws BeanNotFoundException for missing/invalid bean names 
Test buildChain() handles empty/null phase configurations appropriately

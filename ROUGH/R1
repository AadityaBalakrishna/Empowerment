Hi Rachna, this is Aaditya from the Plat Team 7 (India). I’m working on a task to instrument a few advices in the pcap-server with custom metrics to capture caching behavior and monitor it in Datadog. (These advices are used by pcap-quote and pcap-ace.)

I was hoping you could guide me on how to configure this so that the custom metrics appear in Datadog’s Metrics Explorer. I’ve implemented part of this already (MR: <link to my work>), but I’d like to understand if there are any specific conditions that need to be met for the metrics to show up in Datadog.

Would really appreciate your advice on this

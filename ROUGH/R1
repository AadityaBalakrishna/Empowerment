Notes	Nimbus Object / Field


In a data mapping project from Salesforce object with a redwood or ihub oject, what is Derivation logic (across entities) or Transformation logic?

for example in the SFC object - Referral, there is a field called, industry of data type picklist
but in redwood, under the sp_schema , person table, there is a column of data type varchar(500) with nature_of_business column name, which matches to what we need

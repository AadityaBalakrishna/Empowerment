    @Test
    public void testEncryptUsingAWSKey_ThrowsDisabledException() {
        String plainText = "testPlainText";
        String keyId = "testKeyId";
 
        // Mock the behavior to throw DisabledException
        when(mockKmsClient.encrypt(any(EncryptRequest.class))).thenThrow(new DisabledException("Key is disabled"));
 
        // Call the method and assert that it handles the exception gracefully
        String result = kmsService.encryptUsingAWSKey(plainText, keyId);
 
        assertNull(result, "Result should be null when an exception occurs");
        // Verify that the encrypt method was called
        verify(mockKmsClient, times(1)).encrypt(any(EncryptRequest.class));
    }

what is this test cases, it was shared by my senior was asked if this test cases will pass in my current impl of KMSService, can you add this in the test class i just shared?

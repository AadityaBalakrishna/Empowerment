this is the approach i have used:
 
Metrics.counter(METRICS_NAME, "class", className, "method", methodName, "outcome", outcome)
				.increment();
 
this is the approached used by the "epw.cstmr.sdi.event" metrics in DD dashboard:
 
Counter metricsCount = Metrics.counter(METRICS_NAME, "class", className, "method", methodName, "outcome", outcome);
metricsCount.increment();
 
do you think this would matter?

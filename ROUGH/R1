#### Bean Selection Priority for KMS Service
1. **SDK Version-Specific Beans**
   - When `epw.aws.kms.sdk-version=v2`:
     - Creates SDK v2 beans: 
       - 'epwKmsClient' (`KmsClient`).
       - 'epwKmsService' (`EpwKMSServiceImpl` for SDK v2)
   - When not set or `epw.aws.kms.sdk-version=v1`:
     - Creates SDK v1 beans:
       - 'epwAWSKMSClient' (`AWSKMS`).
       - 'epwKmsService' (`EpwKMSServiceImpl` for SDK v1)
2. **Bean Selection Mechanism**
   - Uses `@ConditionalOnProperty` to control which beans are created based on the `epw.aws.kms.sdk-version` property.
   - Uses '@Primary' to mark the appropriate bean as the default for injection.
3. **Default Fallback (Lowest Priority)**
   - If `epw.aws.kms.sdk-version` is not set, the configuration:
     - Defaults to SDK v1 beans.
     - Creates 'AWSKMS' and 'EpwKMSServiceImpl' for v1.

in light of those new changes, could you help me refactor this to:

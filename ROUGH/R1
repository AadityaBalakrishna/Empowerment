Here's a revised version of your Development Item Goal that includes both SQL, Agile, and Kubernetes:

Development Item: Improve SQL, Agile, and Kubernetes Skills
Status: I plan to improve my SQL skills by practicing writing complex queries and learning database best practices. Additionally, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of Agile methodologies by participating in team sprints and retrospectives. I will also familiarize myself with Kubernetes by working with the team to deploy applications. I will seek feedback from senior teammates to ensure I'm applying these concepts effectively.

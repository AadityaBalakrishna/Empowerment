i have a doubt regarding bean creation :
previously, i had to refactor a class in the module sp-security, KMSServiceImpl to delegate to EpwKmsService and another class, CryptEngine used to be a direct consumer of KMSServiceImpl and i had to mention @Autowired EpwKmsService epwKmsService in CryptEngine and everything within sp-security was working fine, but in pcap-server, there were other classes in other modules who were consumers of cryptengine and i used to get an error in the jenkins :" Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No qualifying bean of type 'com.empower.epw.aws.api.kms.EpwKmsService' available: expected at least 1 bean which qualifies as autowire candidate. Dependency annotations: {@org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired(required=true)}" and i used to fix it with mock of epwKMsservice or providing the bean in the xml

but now, sp-security module was moved out of pcap-server , so along with it the KMSServiceImpl and Cryptengine files are also moved out of the pcap-server repo, so shoul i still go back to pcap-server and use the epwkmsservice in xml files?

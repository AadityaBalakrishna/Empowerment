this is the error i am getting in jenkins:

20:08:58  [ERROR] Tests run: 16, Failures: 0, Errors: 15, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.89 s <<< FAILURE! - in com.safepage.helper.SalesForceHelperMockedTest
20:08:58  [ERROR] testRetryRegistrationWithAffiliatedUserOn11Run(com.safepage.helper.SalesForceHelperMockedTest)  Time elapsed: 0.009 s  <<< ERROR!
20:08:58  org.mockito.exceptions.misusing.RedundantListenerException: 
20:08:58  
20:08:58  Problems adding Mockito listener.
20:08:58  Listener of type 'MismatchReportingTestListener' has already been added and not removed.
20:08:58  It indicates that previous listener was not removed according to the API.
20:08:58  When you add a listener, don't forget to remove the listener afterwards:
20:08:58    Mockito.framework().removeListener(myListener);
20:08:58  For more information, see the javadoc for RedundantListenerException class.

but in local this tests are passing, but that error i sent earlier was the only failure in local

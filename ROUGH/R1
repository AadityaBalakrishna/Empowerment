20:42:33  2025-07-24 08:12:33,671 WARN main [com.safepage.security.CryptEngine] [] [] [] [] - Failed to decrypt because:
20:42:33  java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "com.safepage.security.service.impl.KMSServiceImpl.decryptUsingAWSKey(String)" because "<local3>.kmsService" is null

right, now all the task related work is done, next step is to make the existing internal consumers work 
Find all internal consumers that use KMSServiceImpl.getInstance() (like crypt-engine).
Refactor them to use @Autowired dependency injection.
Self-Validation:

Ensure the entire pcap-server compiles successfully.
Update and run the unit tests for the refactored consumer classes.

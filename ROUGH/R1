what was done so far:
Created AWS KMS V2 versions of KMSService.java, KMSServiceImpl.java, and KMSServiceImplTest.java. Tested these changes in the KMSCompatibilityTest.java file to verify that any data encrypted using the V1 implementation can be successfully decrypted using the V2 implementation, and any data encrypted using the V2 implementation can be successfully decrypted using the V1 implementation, ensuring the original plaintext value is retained.

New task:

Create the new, clean EpwKmsService interface and any necessary DTOs.
Create the empty class files for EpwKmsServiceImpl(v1) and EpwKmsServiceImpl(v2).
Set up the integration test class with Testcontainers and LocalStack.

Self-Validation:
Write a simple unit test to ensure the new DTOs work as expected.

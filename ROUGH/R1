I can't directly extract text from the image, but based on your screenshot, I can list the class names I see in the pcap-command module:

Classes in pcap-command

batch package:

AggregationBatchManager


command.dispatcher package:

ExactTargetQueueDispatcher

JobsCCommandDispatcher


command.salesforce package:

SFCallingQueuePayload


utils package:

AdviceQueueCommandUtils

QueueCommandUtils

BaseQueueCommand

QueueCommand

QueueCommandDetails

QueueCommandDispatcher

QueueCommandInfo

QueueCommandRequest

QueueCommandResponse

QueueDispatchType


et.data package:

DataExtension


et.service package:

ExactTargetConstants


et.utils package:

ExactTargetCommandUtils


referral package:

RebrandedUcsSalesforceSyncPayload

UserReferralPayload


safepage.aggregation.data.impl package:

AggregationQueueImpl

QueueStatus


Test Classes in test directory

This should cover most of the classes visible in your screenshot. If you need to extract class names programmatically, I can guide you through a script to do it efficiently. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

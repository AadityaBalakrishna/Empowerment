Example #3: Development Item Goal
Development Item: I want to build my data analyzing and Excel skills.
Additional Information: Learning advanced skills will help me do this work faster and allow me
the time to do a more in-depth analysis of the data. In the long run, this will help our team
focus on more important, impactful work. It will also help me grow skills that align to my career
aspirations as I know that advanced Excel skills are required for a data analyst. I would also like
to spend time with some of our data analysts to show how I run our data now and learn how to
tell a story with the data.
I will take the LinkedIn Learning courses on Excel and practice them over the next three months
and meet with at least one data analyst within the next month. By May 1, I would like to present
what I have learned to the team.
Status Notes: (written later in the year) I have taken one Excel course and learned pivot tables. I
also met with one of the data analysts and she showed me some ways to cut the data, so the
context was more relevant and clearer. I am taking another Excel course on macros starting
April 1. My next goal is to put together a compelling presentation of the data for the team.

I would like my QA to validate one of my task, it involves removing a module pcap-analytics-dao from a repos called pcap-server, out of the 16 files, 4 were used by pcap-appps-common, so it was moved there:
TransactionClassificationData.java
TransactionData.java
AdvisoryFeeCategorizationEngine.java
TrainingData.java

the rest weren't used anywhere in the code base, hence was removed:
PcapAnalyticsDataSourceConfig.java
AnalyticsBaseDaoImpl.java
TrainingDataDaoImpl.java, 
TrainingDataImpl.java 
TrainingDataDao.java 
pcap-analytics-dao/src/main/resources/META-INF/analytics-persistence.xml
pcap-analytics-dao/src/main/resources/hikaricpSpSchema.configurationFile
pcap-analytics-dao/src/main/resources/pcap-analytics-dao.xml
pcap-analytics-dao/src/main/resources/pcap-analytics-data.xml
pcap-analytics-dao/src/main/resources/pcap-training-data-dao.xml
TrainingDataDaoTest.java [ Test is disabled ]
pcap-analytics-dao/src/test/resources/pcapAnalyticsApplicationContext.xml

in these consumers: initially the pcap-analytics-dao was just mentioned in the parent pom file under the dependencyManagement block and now after clean up even that is removed:
pcap-root, epw-wm-artifacts, pcap-salesforce, pcap-server, pcap-agent, pcap-admin, pcap-mv, pcap-ace 

So how can i assign my QA the task to validate that these changes has not broken anything and everythign is good for story signoff, also the migration of the 4 files to pcap-apps-common is validated

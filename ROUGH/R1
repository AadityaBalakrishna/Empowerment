# We added a VOLUME pointing to "/tmp" because that is where a Spring Boot application creates working directories
# for Tomcat by default. The effect is to create a temporary file on your host under "/var/lib/docker" and link
# it to the container under "/tmp". This step is optional for the simple app that we wrote here, but can be necessary
# for other Spring Boot applications if they need to actually write in the filesystem.
VOLUME /tmp

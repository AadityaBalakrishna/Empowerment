In jenkins this test that we wrote is passing - SpsCirrusContactMetadataRepositoryTest

but other tests are failing - 
22:20:32  [ERROR] com.safepage.invest.data.impl.SecurityInfoDaoCacheJacksonSerializerTest.getSecurityInfoBySourceAssetId_SecurityId -- Time elapsed: 0 s <<< ERROR!
22:20:32  org.mockito.exceptions.base.MockitoException: 
22:20:32  
22:20:32  Cannot instantiate @InjectMocks field named 'securityInfoDao'! Cause: the type 'SecurityInfoDao' is an interface.
22:20:32  You haven't provided the instance at field declaration so I tried to construct the instance.
22:20:32  Examples of correct usage of @InjectMocks:
22:20:32     @InjectMocks Service service = new Service();
22:20:32     @InjectMocks Service service;
22:20:32     //and... don't forget about some @Mocks for injection :)

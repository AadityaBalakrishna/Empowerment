Great follow-up! Checking for cyclic dependencies can be a bit more complex since Maven does not directly flag cycles in the dependency tree as conflicts. However, there are several ways to detect and resolve cyclic dependencies in your Maven project.

Ways to Check for Cyclic Dependencies:


---

1. Using Maven Enforcer Plugin (for cyclic dependency detection)

You can use the Maven Enforcer Plugin with the banCircularDependencies rule, which will explicitly check for cyclic dependencies.

Add the plugin to your pom.xml:

<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-enforcer-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>3.4.1</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>enforce-no-cycles</id>
          <goals>
            <goal>enforce</goal>
          </goals>
          <configuration>
            <rules>
              <banCircularDependencies />
            </rules>
            <fail>true</fail>
          </configuration>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>

Then run:

mvn enforcer:enforce -Drules=banCircularDependencies

If there is a circular dependency, you’ll get an error message like this:

[ERROR] Found cycle: A -> B -> A


---

2. Using mvn dependency:tree (Manual Check)

Running mvn dependency:tree helps you visualize how dependencies are resolved, and you can manually spot cycles. However, this approach requires more attention since Maven doesn’t explicitly flag cycles.

Run:

mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose

Look at the output for any dependencies that appear multiple times in a circular pattern. A cyclic dependency typically shows up when a dependency appears again somewhere in the tree, directly or indirectly referring back to an ancestor.

3. IntelliJ IDEA (for GUI-based detection)

While the Community edition doesn’t support Analyze > Analyze Dependencies, you can use IntelliJ Ultimate to visualize cyclic dependencies in your project.

If you're using Ultimate:

1. Go to Analyze > Analyze Dependencies.


2. Select the modules you want to inspect.


3. Choose "Show Cyclic Dependencies" — this will show you any circular references.



In IntelliJ CE, your best bet is to use Maven Helper to manually examine transitive dependencies.


---

4. Use Graph-Based Tools (Advanced)

For a more graphical analysis of your dependency tree, you can use Graphviz or other tools to generate a visual representation of your Maven dependencies.

Here’s how to generate a DOT file (Graphviz format):

mvn dependency:tree -DoutputType=dot -DoutputFile=deps.dot

You can then visualize it with a tool like Graphviz or any online graph viewer to easily spot cycles.


---

5. Using jdeps (Advanced)

jdeps analyzes class-level dependencies and can help identify circular dependencies in modules (especially useful if you're working with Java 9+ modules).

Run:

jdeps --recursive --module-path target/classes path/to/your/module.jar

It will show if any classes or modules reference each other in a circular manner.

TL;DR:

To detect cyclic dependencies:

1. Use the Maven Enforcer Plugin with banCircularDependencies (best for direct checks).


2. Manually inspect mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose for patterns.


3. Use IntelliJ Ultimate to visually spot cycles (for GUI-based work).


4. Generate dependency graphs with mvn dependency:tree -DoutputType=dot and view them in a graph tool.


5. Use jdeps for Java module-level analysis.

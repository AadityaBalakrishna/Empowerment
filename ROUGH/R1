Yes, I reviewed all of those issues and your code does not currently fix the root problem.

üî• What's Still Wrong
You're using this class:
EpwKmsServiceImpl
And inside it, everything is fine ‚Äî encryption and decryption are both correctly expecting and returning Strings. That‚Äôs not the problem.

The real issue lies outside EpwKmsServiceImpl, in how you use it ‚Äî especially in lines like this (from your test):

accountRoutingNumberData.setName("EPW Account");
accountRoutingNumberData.setSource("yodlee");
actualAccount.saveAccountRoutingNumberData(user, accountRoutingNumberData);
You're likely doing this inside saveAccountRoutingNumberData(...):

EncryptRequestDTO req = new EncryptRequestDTO();
req.setPlaintext(accountRoutingNumberData); // ‚ùå WRONG
But this setPlaintext(...) expects a String, not an object. The object gets toString()'d implicitly, which produces garbage like:

com.personalcapital.user.data.impl.AccountRoutingNumberData@7d9d0818
That‚Äôs why decryption fails ‚Äî the JSON never got serialized in the first place.

‚úÖ What You Need To Do
In the place where you're calling EpwKmsService.encrypt(...), make sure to serialize to JSON manually before encrypting.

‚úÖ Fix in Your Consumer Code (e.g. AccountDTO)
Wherever you encrypt objects like AccountRoutingNumberData, fix it like this:

FIX:
ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
String json = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(accountRoutingNumberData); // ‚úÖ correct

EncryptRequestDTO request = EncryptRequestDTO.builder()
    .plaintext(json)
    .keyId(...) // provide the correct keyId or alias
    .build();

EncryptResponseDTO response = epwKmsService.encrypt(request);

And for decryption:
DecryptRequestDTO request = DecryptRequestDTO.builder()
    .ciphertext(encryptedString)
    .build();

String json = epwKmsService.decrypt(request).getPlaintext();

AccountRoutingNumberData decrypted = objectMapper.readValue(json, AccountRoutingNumberData.class);

you told all of the above, but can you implement the same in a different consumer, cryptengine, the root of this issue?

these are the inputs from the manager:

it is for readiness , that means, we are getting things ready needed for all sort of SQS scenarios, read, write, retry., deadletter,...
next, I asked to write publish it in Test Case. and verify in Test case
i prefer producer, consumer, error retry, dead letter all these learnt, implemented, so other developers who wud like to implement it can refer here than doing another R&D. you can disable the producer wth  a flag same way we did for listener. that is the requriement for readiness
